This repository contains a Julia function that demonstrates an issue with floating-point number precision. The function `myfunction` calculates the square of positive numbers and the negation of negative numbers. While it works correctly for integers, it may produce unexpected results when dealing with floating-point numbers due to the limitations of floating-point representation. The solution file provides a modified version that addresses the precision issue.
